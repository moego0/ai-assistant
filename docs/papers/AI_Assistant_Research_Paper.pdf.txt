AI Assistant: Voice-Controlled Smart Home Automation
Research Paper

Abstract:
This paper presents an innovative approach to voice-controlled smart home automation using artificial intelligence. We introduce an AI Assistant system that combines wake word detection, natural language processing, and smart device control in a unified platform. The system demonstrates significant improvements in user interaction, response time, and automation capabilities compared to existing solutions.
